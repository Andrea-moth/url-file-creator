# url-file-creator

I use .url files a fair amount so I decided to make this 

*Yes I know there was probably a better way to do this, I just wanted to do it myself


[Running]
URL 

-- The site you want to add
*May take a while to respond 
*Must be full url 


Path

-- The path you want to add the .url file to 


Name

-- The name of the file 
*Including .url is not nessaccary
